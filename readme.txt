Some info on why i did this:

Author: Plasma	-	(Put all of this together and made the .bat file)

Name: Andrew Armstrong

Notice: As far as i know, this is illigal to register these controls, but who cares!

Why did i do this?

I have come across so many people on www.PlanetSourceCode.com/vb/ (PSC) that complain about not
even having winsock in the first place, and if they did, it diddent let them use it in design time, just gave them a crappy notice about a license. And i once diddent have winsock, and it
pissed me off. And so i found the reg code and file, and put them in this package. And so here you go!

What this dose:

Copy's the files MSWINSCK.OCX and MSINET.OCX to your C:\windows\system directory,
registers them with your computer (So they appear in the control list, and work)
and removes the crappy lisence warning when trying to put the control on a form.
